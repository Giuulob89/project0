         <h1 id = "description" > Description and objectives of the WebSite:</h1>
         <p>
           This site has the clear objective to let people share and express some of their feelings and thoughts in shape of art. The interest too is to know more tipes of points of view and kinds of expression that make the others understand it. Think that here is like a public blog, but, instead of only write, you can read about other people and new subjects too.
         </p>
